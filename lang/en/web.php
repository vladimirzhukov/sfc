    'wa_23' => 'The concept of informal collaborative work sessions has transformed how independent professionals connect and create. What started as a simple solution to home office isolation has evolved into a global movement that redefined the future of work.',
    'wa_24' => 'The mid-2000s marked a turning point for independent workers. As freelancers, remote employees, and entrepreneurs grew in numbers, a critical challenge emerged: <strong>professional and social isolation</strong>. Coffee shops offered temporary relief, but lacked the consistent community that creative minds craved.',
    'wa_25' => 'The breakthrough came in February 2006 when two friends in <strong>New York City</strong>, Amit Gupta and Luke Crawford, decided to tackle this problem head-on. Working from separate home offices, they missed the creative energy and spontaneous collaboration of traditional workspaces. Their solution was elegantly simple: invite friends to work together from Amit\'s Chelsea loft for a day.',
    'wa_26' => 'They called it "Jelly" - envisioning a group of independent professionals (invertebrates without rigid corporate structure) "jamming together." The tagline captured everything: "<strong>Show up with a laptop and work alongside others.</strong>"',
    'wa_27' => 'Open-source movement.',
    'wa_28' => 'Jelly was intentionally free and unstructured. No fees, no forced networking, no rigid schedules. People could arrive and leave as their productivity demanded, creating natural workflow rhythms.',
    'wa_29' => 'Viral community growth.',
    'wa_30' => 'The concept spread organically across dozens, then hundreds of cities worldwide. Anyone with suitable space could host their own Jelly, supported by wiki documentation and grassroots enthusiasm.',
    'wa_31' => 'Foundation for coworking.',
    'wa_32' => 'Jelly proved massive untapped demand for flexible, community-driven workspaces. This proof of concept directly inspired the coworking industry boom that followed, including giants like WeWork.',
    'wa_33' => 'Jelly wasn\'t about the time of day - it was about transforming the where and how of independent work. This grassroots solution to digital age isolation became the catalyst for an entire industry that fundamentally reshaped our understanding of what an "office" can be.',
    'wa_34' => 'The catalyst that changed everything',
    'wa_35' => 'Today\'s Working Afternoons carry forward this same spirit: creating spaces where productivity meets community, where isolation transforms into collaboration, and where the best work happens naturally alongside others who share the journey.',
