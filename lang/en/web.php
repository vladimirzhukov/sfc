    'wa_24' => 'The mid-2000s marked a turning point for independent workers. As freelancers, remote employees, and entrepreneurs grew in numbers, a critical challenge emerged: <strong>professional and social isolation</strong>. Coffee shops offered temporary relief, but lacked the consistent community that creative minds craved.',
    'wa_25' => 'The breakthrough came in February 2006 when two friends in <strong>New York City</strong>, Amit Gupta and Luke Crawford, decided to tackle this problem head-on. Working from separate home offices, they missed the creative energy and spontaneous collaboration of traditional workspaces.

    'wa_30' => 'The concept spread organically across dozens, then hundreds of cities worldwide. Anyone with suitable space could host their own Jelly, supported by wiki documentation and grassroots enthusiasm.',
    'wa_31' => 'Foundation for coworking.',
    'wa_32' => 'Jelly proved massive untapped demand for flexible, community-driven workspaces. This proof of concept directly inspired the coworking industry boom that followed, including giants like WeWork.',
    'wa_33' => 'Jelly wasn\'t about the time of day - it was about transforming the where and how of independent work. This grassroots solution to digital age isolation became the catalyst for an entire industry that fundamentally reshaped our understanding of what an "office" can be.',
    'wa_34' => 'The catalyst that changed everything',
    'wa_35' => 'Today\'s Working Afternoons carry forward this same spirit: creating spaces where productivity meets community, where isolation transforms into collaboration, and where the best work happens naturally alongside others who share the journey.',
